**SUMMONERS CHALLENGE**

Underneath the casino, down a dusty cooridor there lives a mysterious sorcerer; colloquially known as the summoner.

To anyone who dares to enter his layer he offers a chance to play him in the summoner's challenge. The summoner's challenge is a simple game of chance with the following rules.

1. The challenger chooses a wager and a type of monster to summon
2. The summoner's assistant, Gibbens, will choose a type of monster at random for the summoner
3. The challenger's monster rolls between 1 and 100 power
4. The summoner's monster rolls between 1 and 101 power
5. An adjustment is made based on the chosen monster types
6. Whichever monster has the highest number after adjustments wins! (A tie goes to the summoner)

If the challenger wins they are paid double their bet minus the house fee for playing.

If the summoner wins he keeps the wager.

_Monster Types:_

1. Water
2. Stone
3. Heat
4. Toxic

Choosing a dominant type results in a +2 adjustment to the roll of either the player or the summoner; whoever chose the dominant type. Type effects are circular as follows:

`Water > Stone > Heat > Toxic > Water`

Types only come into play if they are next to eachother on this list. For example if the player chose `Toxic` and the summoner chose `Water` then the player would receive +2 to their roll. On the other hand if the player chose `Toxic` and the summoner chose `Stone` there would not be an adjustment since Toxic and Stone are not neighbors in the list.
